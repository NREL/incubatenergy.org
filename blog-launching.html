<p>The Clean Energy Incubators Network officially launches during the second week of February 2015 at the ARPA-E Innovation Summit in Washington D.C. and we want to hear from innovators who are interested in joining the community! Through growing this network, our main goal is to better support entrepreneurs driving innovation in the industry, ultimately helping to facilitate a smoother transition to a more sustainable clean energy economy.</p>

<p>If you are an energy entrepreneur, this network is designed to provide you with a collection of the top resources you need to launch your company or commercialize your technology, including information about leading incubators, funding opportunities, testing facilities, mentors, and more. Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/incubatenergy">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Incubatenergy">Twitter</a> to stay updated on the latest developments relevant to your idea, whether your focus is solar, transportation, smart homes, or another area related to clean energy. </p>

<p>For incubators, investors, and other industry stakeholders, this network is designed to create stronger connections between leading innovators, allowing you to learn from each other and interact with your peers. Through fostering these connections, each group can improve their efforts based on the experiences of others around the country, elevating the level of support provided to entrepreneurs everywhere. </p>

<p>The founding incubator members of the network are the <a href="http://ati.utexas.edu/">Austin Technology Incubator</a> (ATI), <a href="http://www.cleanenergytrust.org/">Clean Energy Trust</a> (CET) in Chicago and <a href="http://www.nextenergy.org/">NextEnergy</a> in Detroit, and the <a href="http://laincubator.org/">LA Cleantech Incubator</a> (LACI) in California. These incubators form the core community group, serving as the foundation for the network as it grows to include additional members from clean energy stakeholders around the country. </p>

<p>With disruptive innovation increasing across all areas of the energy industry, now is an especially exciting time for clean energy entrepreneurs and incubators to collaborate with industry stakeholders in building a more dynamic and sustainable clean energy economy. Distributed generation, automation, sensors, micro grids, electric cars, and storage are just some of the areas experiencing dramatic change, and this will surely only accelerate as <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/tipping-over-the-oil-barrel">tipping points are reached across clean energy technologies</a>.</p>

<p>This accelerating clean energy innovation makes forming the Clean Energy Incubators Network now more important than ever. Learn more about the new network in the <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-invests-32-million-support-clean-energy-small-businesses-and">official press release here</a>, and stay tuned for updates as the community grows stronger! We look forward to helping support entrepreneurs, incubators, and other innovators in the clean energy space.</p>
